This repository contains a simple landing page for **Kashif Umair Liaqat**, a software engineer.

## GitHub Pages

The site is prepared for GitHub Pages hosting. Simply enable Pages in your repository settings using the `main` branch as the source. A `.nojekyll` file is included to disable Jekyll processing so this static site renders exactly as written.
